Hi. if you are reading this, it is likely you are on a Toolips server at this very second. Toolips is an HTTP.jl-based templating framework for web-development. The core focus on the package is to combine object-oriented calls with function calls and stream writing to make a pretty effective combination. Input is handled universally through requests, but the requests are automatically setup for you. Furthermore, the syntax is done with relative ease, and so is the package.
