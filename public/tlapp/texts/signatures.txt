I am not exactly sure why this is, but for some reason, once the files are saved then loaded they have a lot of plus signs on them. I thought it would be pretty cool though if everyone who viewed this document signed it, and then this text document will be pushed to the main repository. Feel free to leave a link with your signature. Or feel free to destroy the file and hurt everyone's feelings in the process, there are no rules here.
